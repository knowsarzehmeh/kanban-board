# Technical assignment front-end engineer
Create a minimal Kanban board on which you can create and view tickets.

Your task is to:

- be able to create tickets on the board and move them between the various columns in an interactive way.
- be able to share a direct link to the ticket.

You are free to use the frameworks and tools you prefer, however, we strongly suggest you keep the hard skills of the job offer in mind.

**Minimal requirements**

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.
* Use React
* Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care.
* Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using your favourite styling solution.
* Interact with an API. [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) can be used to add a fake REST API or you can decide to build your own.

**Timing**

You have one week to complete the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but quality(!) and a reasonable delivery time are always highly appreciated. 
Please send us an email (jobs@madewithlove.com) when you think the assignment is ready for review. Please mention your name, Github username, and a link to what we need to review.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## BACKEND WITH JSON-SERVER
This is used as a fake rest-api- the backend is running on port `:8000`
To start the backend server run `npm run start:server` on the terminal and all service will be served on `http://localhost:8000`


## UI INSPIRATION
The UI design was gotten from dribble from this url [Kanban View Concept Dribble Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/16466111-Kanban-View-Concept) by `Afrian Hanafi`, although not all functionalities on the design was implemented, the scope was to focus on the assignment
